## Short Project Description
This application uses the Spotify API. Spotify users may publish playlists they have created or are following for voting. <br>
This feature enables guests, friends and family to place their vote on a playlist and in that way express their opinion about the published playlists. Furthermore caf√© owners, dinner hosts and party planners can get an overview of how appreciated different playlists are.
